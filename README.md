# Reverse Engineering React
Based on https://blog.angularindepth.com/practical-application-of-reverse-engineering-guidelines-and-principles-784c004bb657

I only had a really high level idea about the React's Fiber refactor, after reading Max Wizard K's article I decided it was time to dive deeper.

Citing Max `As you go through the source code, youâ€™ll become familiar with the new design patterns to solve common problems which you can then reuse at work.`. React codebase looked like it could be a gold mine of knowledge... I was super intrigued about react's suspense, scheduling, reconciling, etc. So, lets see what can I learn from this exploration.
